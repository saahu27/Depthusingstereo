
Change the file path and run the code.

Some of the code has been referred online. it was also cited in the comments of the code.

For the epipolar lines function, i have used an online code. 
If there is a penalty for this, please consider this : there is also a code using opencv libraries which has been implemented and commented.

also, the computation is very high for the dynamic programming formulation and i have managed to tune some results please find below the values that i found to be good

for dataset2 : height_block = 4, max_ssd = 50, depth = +1e^35

for dataset1 : height_block = 5, max_ssd = 10

for dataset3 : height_block = 5, max_ss = 50
