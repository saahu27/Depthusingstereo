the computation is very high for the dynamic programming formulation and i have managed to tune some results please find below the values that i found to be good

for dataset2 : height_block = 4, max_ssd = 50, depth = +1e^35

for dataset1 : height_block = 5, max_ssd = 10

for dataset3 : height_block = 5, max_ss = 50
